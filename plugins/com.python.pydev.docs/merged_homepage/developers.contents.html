<h1><a name="PyDevDevelopers-Gettingthecode"></a>Getting the code</h1>

<p>The first thing you probably want to do in order to code in PyDev is <b>getting its code</b>.</p>

<p><b>Pre-requisites:</b> Eclipse SDK 3.7.0, Git and Java 5.0 (note that other versions of those should work too but details may differ a bit)</p>

<p>Before getting the code, there's an important step you need to make: Change your java 'compiler compliance-level' to 5.0. To do this, go to <b>window &gt; preferences &gt; Java &gt; compiler</b> and change that setting from <b>1.4 to 5.0</b>.</p>

<h2><a name="PyDevDevelopers-Repository"></a>Repository</h2>

<p>Get the code with Git from <a href="https://github.com/aptana/Pydev" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/aptana/Pydev</a> (ideally, fork it at github, create your own branch at the forked repository &#45;&#45; usually based in the development branch &#45;&#45; and later send a pull request on github so that the code can be merged back). Later, if you want to provide some other feature/bugfix, a new branch should be created again.</p>

<p>Then, in Eclipse, go to: <b>File &gt; Import &gt; Existing projects into workspace</b> and point it to the root of the repository you just downloaded.</p>

<p>Note that currently PyDev has a project (org.python.pydev.red_core) which has a dependency on Aptana Studio 3, so, if you plan on doing a local build, you'll need to get Aptana Studio 3 installed as a plugin in the SDK used for the build (i.e.: not necessarily in the SDK you use for developing), now if you don't need to do a local build (i.e.: just do your local changes and run Eclipse with your changes from within the SDK and contribute that as a patch later on), you can just close this project so that it doesn't get compiled.</p>

<p>Important: Before doing any changes to the code it's important to  note that you should create a new branch (usually based on the development branch) for doing code changes. See: <a href="http://book.git-scm.com/3_basic_branching_and_merging.html" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">http://book.git-scm.com/3_basic_branching_and_merging.html</a> and also <a href="http://nvie.com/git-model" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">http://nvie.com/git-model</a> for details on creating and using branches.</p>

<p><b>Note</b>: for running the tests, a file: <b>org.python.pydev.core/tests/org.python.pydev.core/TestDependent.OS.properties</b> must have the values set regarding to the computer that'll execute the tests.</p>

<p>If the head does not compile in git, send an e-mail to the pydev-code list at sourceforge to know what's  happening.</p>

<h1><a name="PyDevDevelopers-Wheretostart%3F"></a>Where to start?</h1>

<p>Ok, this may be the most difficult thing... especially because  answers may change a lot depending on what you want to do, so, below are outlined 2 different approaches:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Extending PyDev <b>with Jython</b>: recommended if you  want to add some editor-related action or something that does not need  implementing some Eclipse extension-point.</li>
</ul>


<ul>
	<li>Extending PyDev <b>in Java</b>: if you want something that won't map to an action, this might be the better way to go.</li>
</ul>


<p>To start in any of those approaches it might be worth taking a look  at some Eclipse documentation, to try to grasp some of its concepts. One  of the finest documentations for that is the <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/Eclipse_FAQs" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Eclipse FAQ</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to take the Jython approach, check out this article on how to do <a href="manual_articles_scripting.html" title="PyDev Jython Scripting">jython scripting in PyDev</a></p>


<p>For supporting a new Python based language, the first step would be  creating a grammar that can parse it while providing a Python like AST. See: <a href="developers_grammar.html" title="PyDev Grammar">PyDev Grammar</a> for instructions on that.</p>

<p>And that's it. If you have further doubts about how to code in PyDev, direct your questions to the <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/pydev-code" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">pydev-code list</a> at sourceforge.</p>

<p>Provided that the steps were followed, PyDev should have the following structure:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>/builders<br/>
/org.python.pydev.build</p>

<p>/features<br/>
/org.python.pydev.feature</p>

<p>/plugins<br/>
/org.python.pydev<br/>
... (other plugins)</p></blockquote>

<p>Now, on to the build: start a shell and follow the instructions at  /plugins/org.python.pydev.build/build_cmd.txt (read the end of the file  for details on customizing it properly)</p>
