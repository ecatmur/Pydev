Hi All,

Release Highlights:
-------------------------------

* From now on, PyDev requires Eclipse 3.7 or 4.3 onwards and Java 7! For older versions, keep using PyDev 2.x.
 
* Interpreter is now kept up to date with changes to the interpreter, so, pip-installing packages will automatically update internal caches without requiring a manual step.
 
* Fixed issue connecting to shell for code-completion (which could halt the IDE).
 
* Interactive Console (patches by Jonah Graham)
 
    * IPython 1.0 is now supported.
    
    * Computational Crystallography Toolbox (CCTBX: http://cctbx.sourceforge.net/) can now be used with PyDev.
    
    * Debug support in interactive console (must be enabled in preferences).
    
    * User Module Deleter (UMD): forcefully reloads user-loaded modules when using runfile on interactive console (must be enabled in preferences).
    
    * GUI event loop integration: more backends are now supported and can be configured in the preferences.
    
    * %gui provides customization for the gui event loop integration (i.e.: %gui wx enables wxPython integration).
    
    * %edit on IPython will open the file in the PyDev editor.
    
    * History of commands is now saved to a persistent file.
    
    * Loading of history is faster.
    
* Interpreter configuration (patches by Andrew Ferrazzutti)
 
    * Interpreter configuration quick auto-config: automatically finds a Python installed and configures it.

    * Interpreter configuration advanced auto-config: searches for multiple Python installations in the computer and allows selecting one to configure.
    
    * Source folders (PYTHONPATH) are kept updated on renames and moves in the PyDev package explorer.
    
* Grammar 3.x accepts u'str'.
 
* Fixed project configuration ${PROJECT_DIR_NAME} variable to point to dir name inside Eclipse and not the folder name in filesystem (this could make PyDev miss folders in the project PYTHONPATH).
 
* Debugger:
 
    * Breakpoints working on files with unicode chars.
     
    * patches by Jonah Graham:
     
        * Variables can be pretty-printed with right-click > pretty print.
        
        * Improved handling for numpy.ndarrays.
    
* And as usual, many other bugfixes!

What is PyDev?
